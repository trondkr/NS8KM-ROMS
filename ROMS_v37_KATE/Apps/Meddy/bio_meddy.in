! Input parameters can be entered in ANY order, provided that the parameter   !
! KEYWORD (usually, upper case) is typed correctly followed by "="  or "=="   !
! symbols. Any comment lines are allowed and must begin with an exclamation   !
! mark (!) in column one.  Comments may  appear to the right of a parameter   !
! specification to improve documentation.  All comments will ignored during   !
! reading.  Blank lines are also allowed and ignored. Continuation lines in   !
! a parameter specification are allowed and must be preceded by a backslash   !
! (\).  In some instances, more than one value is required for a parameter.   !
! If fewer values are provided, the  last value  is assigned for the entire   !
! parameter array.  The multiplication symbol (*),  without blank spaces in   !
! between, is allowed for a parameter specification.  For example, in a two   !

! indicates that the first two entries of array AKT_BAK,  in fortran column-  !
! major order, will have the same value of "1.0d-6" for grid 1,  whereas the  !

! "Ngrids" entries are expected for some of these parameters.  In such case,  !

!  Lbiology  Switch to control the computation of a particular module within
!              nested and/or multiple connected grids. By default this switch
!              is set to TRUE in "mod_scalars" for all grids.  Ngrids values
!              are expected. The USER has the option, for example, to compute
!              the biology in just one of the nested grids. If so, this switch
!              needs to be consistent with the dimension parameter NBT in
!              "mod_param".  In order to make the model more efficient in
!              memory usage, NBT(:) should be zero in such grids.
!
!  TNU2      Lateral, Laplacian, constant, mixing coefficient (m2/s) for
!            biological tracer variables.  NBT values are expected.  If
!            variable horizontal diffusion is activated, TNU2 is the mixing
!            coefficient for the largest grid-cell in the domain.
!
!  TNU4      Lateral, biharmonic, constant, mixing coefficient (m4/s) for
!            biological tracer variables.  NBT values are expected.  If
!            variable horizontal diffusion is activated, TNU4 is the mixing
!            coefficient for the largest grid-cell in the domain.
!
!  TNUDG     Nudging time scale (days), TNUDG(idbio(i)) with i=1:NBT.
!              Inverse scale will be computed internally,
!
!  Hout      Logical switches to write out biological tracers into HISTORY
!              NetCDF.  NBT values are expected.
