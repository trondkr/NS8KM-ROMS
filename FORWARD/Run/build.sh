#    flags such as ROMS_APPLICATION. Browse the makefile to see these.  :::
#    If an option in the makefile uses the syntax ?= in setting the     :::

#    variable by that name is set in the shell that calls make. If so   :::
#    the environment variable value overrides the default (and the      :::
#    user need not maintain separate makefiles, or frequently edit      :::
#    the makefile, to run separate applications).                       :::

# is that when working simultaneously on multiple machines (e.g. a local

# the latest release and always get an up-to-date customized source on each
# machine. This script is designed to more easily allow for differing paths
